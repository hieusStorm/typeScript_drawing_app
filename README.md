# Overview


This software is a basic drawing app using typeScript and HTML5 canvas

I choose to write this project to help learn the difference between javascript and typescript, with using the dom and refreshing my knowledge of the canvas element to some degree. This also helped me to learn if I want to continue to learn more and become more fluent with typescript

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
